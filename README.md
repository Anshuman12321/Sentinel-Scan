# Sentinel-Scan

## What is Sentinel Scan?
An advanced, AI-powered website vulnerability assessment tool, all in a compact browser extension

## How did we make it?

There were several steps involved with making this. On the back-end side, we had to create, train, and test a neural network that took in data from dozens of websites, sketchy and secure, to train the pattern recognition system to a high degree of accuracy. Alongside this, we code a flask local server to host our back-end code, and with some sweet API work, interfaced it with the front-end browser extension.
